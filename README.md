## Overview

The phoenix is a legendary immortal bird that cyclically regenerates or is reborn from its own ashes after death. Characterized by brilliant plumage in red, gold, and purple, the phoenix is said to live for 500-1000 years. When approaching death, it builds a nest, ignites itself, burns to ashes, and is reborn from those ashes.

Only one phoenix exists at any given time. The concept originated with the Egyptian Bennu bird and was adopted by Greek and Roman mythology. It became a powerful symbol of resurrection in Christianity, transformation in alchemy, and renewal across cultures.

## Theories & Explanations

   Phoenix represents the daily solar cycle: death at sunset, rebirth at dawn.

   Purely symbolic representation of death and rebirth cycle.
